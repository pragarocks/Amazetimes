# 📰 Amazetime.in — AI-Powered News Portal

**Amazetime.in** is a cutting-edge news aggregator that bridges regional reporting with high-end digital journalism. It automatically collects local Tamil news feeds and uses **Google Gemini 3 Flash AI** to rewrite them into professional, engaging editorial content.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Aggregate**: Fetches live RSS feeds from district-wise sources (News18 Tamil, etc.).
2.  **Process**: A Node.js backend script sends raw data to Gemini AI.
3.  **Refine**: AI removes external branding, checks sentiment, and writes a professional headline & summary in Tamil.
4.  **Automate**: GitHub Actions refreshes the entire database every **3 hours** and re-deploys the site.
